This project is a basic front-end implementation of Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search pages.

- **advanced.html**: Google Advanced Search page with inputs for advanced query options, styled like Google's official page.

## Getting Started

2. Open any of the `.html` files in your browser (e.g., via VS Code Live Server).
3. Use the forms to perform searches directly on Google.

## Technologies
